I am a Data Engineer at Swish Analytics working on all things data. As a data engineer, I enjoy writing beautiful, explicit, and readable code. I build data pipelines, architect data infrastructure, manipulate large data sets, construct low latency solutions, utilize advanced analytics, and create machine learning models.

Before joining Swish Analytics, I worked at the Action Network and Pointsbet also as a Data Engineer.
